## Optimal Development Workflow

### **Phase 1: Planning** üìã

**Agents to consult:**

2. **Code Quality Agent** - Plan architecture and code organization

**Questions to ask:**
- "How should I design this feature? What does Benji + Honkish suggest?"
- "What's the best architecture for this? Where should code live?"

---

### **Phase 2: Implementation** üíª

**Primary agent:** Code Quality Agent (keep checking standard compliance)

**Secondary agents:**
- **Design Agent** - As you build, ensure UI matches design philosophy
- **Documentation Agent** - Add JSDoc and comments as you code

**Workflow:**
1. Implement feature following architecture
2. Check with Code Quality Agent for compliance
3. Add Design Agent touches for polish
4. Document with JSDoc as you go

---

### **Phase 3: Testing** ‚úÖ

**Primary agent:** Test Writer Agent

**Questions to ask:**
- "Generate comprehensive tests for this hook (need 100% coverage)"
- "Test this service method"

**Result:** All new code has 100% hook coverage, 80%+ service/component coverage

---

### **Phase 4: Optimization** üöÄ

**Primary agent:** Performance Agent

**Questions to ask:**
- "Profile this screen. Where are the performance bottlenecks?"
- "Optimize this FlatList"

---

### **Phase 5: Bug Fixes** üêõ

**Primary agent:** Bug Squasher Agent

**Questions to ask:**
- "Help me debug this. Here's the error..."
- "Why is this happening?"

**Then:** Use Test Writer to add regression test, then revisit Code Quality Agent

## How to Invoke Agents

In Claude Code, you can invoke agents in a few ways:

### **1. Explicit Invocation** (Recommended)
```
"Use the Design Agent to review this component for Benji + Honkish alignment."

"Ask the Code Quality Agent to check this service for standard compliance."

"Have the Test Writer Agent generate tests for this hook."
```

### **2. Role-Based Request**
```
"Design-wise, how should this look?"  ‚Üí Automatically consults Design Agent

"Code-quality-wise, is this correct?" ‚Üí Automatically consults Code Quality Agent
```

### **3. Let Me Route**
I'll automatically route your request to the right agent based on the context:
```
"I built this new feature. Review it."
‚Üí I'll consult multiple agents in optimal order
```

---

## Agent Availability & Limitations

### **What Agents Can Do**
‚úÖ Review code and suggest improvements
‚úÖ Answer architecture questions
‚úÖ Generate code patterns and examples
‚úÖ Debug and trace issues
‚úÖ Design features and interactions
‚úÖ Suggest optimizations
‚úÖ Generate comprehensive documentation

### **What Agents Cannot Do**
‚ùå Directly edit your files (you do the implementation)
‚ùå Run code or tests (you run them)
‚ùå Make business decisions (that's you)
‚ùå Replace human judgment (they advise, you decide)

---

## Tips for Best Results

### **1. Be Specific**
**Bad:** "Review this code"
**Good:** "Review this service for TypeScript strictness, error handling, and JSDoc completeness"

### **2. Provide Context**
**Bad:** "Why is it slow?"
**Good:** "The timeline scrolls slowly when there are 100+ tasks. It feels like frame drops. What's the bottleneck?"

### **3. Ask for Examples**
**Bad:** "How do I optimize?"
**Good:** "Optimize this FlatList. Show me specific changes and explain why."

### **4. Iterate**
```
You: "Review this code for quality"
Agent: [Suggests improvements]
You: "Can you clarify the TypeScript part?"
Agent: [Explains more]
You: "Now review again"
Agent: [Re-reviews with your feedback]
```

## Agent Decision Tree

```
I'm building something new
  ‚îú‚îÄ Start with Design Agent (UX/UI approach)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Then Code Quality Agent (architecture)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Implement
  ‚îú‚îÄ Review with Code Quality Agent
  ‚îî‚îÄ Test with Test Writer Agent

Something is broken
  ‚îú‚îÄ Start with Bug Squasher Agent (diagnose)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Implement fix
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test with Test Writer Agent
  ‚îî‚îÄ Review with Code Quality Agent

Something feels slow
  ‚îú‚îÄ Start with Performance Agent (profile)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Implement optimization
  ‚îî‚îÄ Verify with Performance Agent again

Something is unclear
  ‚îú‚îÄ Ask Documentation Agent (explain or generate docs)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Add JSDoc

Code isn't meeting standards
  ‚îú‚îÄ Ask Code Quality Agent (what's wrong?)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Fix based on guidance
```

## Maximum Productivity Workflow

**Every feature or bug fix cycle:**

1. **Clarify**: What am I building / fixing?
2. **Design** (if building): Consult Design Agent
3. **Plan** (if building): Consult Code Quality Agent
4. **Implement**: Write code
5. **Review**: Run Code Quality Agent
6. **Document**: Run Documentation Agent
7. **Test**: Run Test Writer Agent
8. **Optimize**: Run Performance Agent
9. **Bug Check**: Run Bug Squasher to review for common issues
10. **Merge**: Everything passes!

**Time investment:**
- Features: ~20% planning + design, ~30% implementation, ~50% testing/review/docs/optimization
- Bug fixes: ~30% diagnosis, ~30% implementation, ~40% testing/verification

---

## Remember

These agents are **force multipliers**, not replacements for your judgment:

- **You** decide what to build
- **Design Agent** advises on how it should feel
- **You** implement
- **Code Quality Agent** advises on standards
- **You** commit the code

The goal is **speed + quality + confidence** in every feature and fix.

Use them liberally. Ask them questions. Iterate. Build amazing things.
